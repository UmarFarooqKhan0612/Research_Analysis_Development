>> The Kalman Filter is a powerful mathematical algorithm used to estimate the true state of a system from a series of noisy or uncertain measurements.

>> Concept

  Imagine you’re trying to track the position of a moving car using a GPS.
  * The GPS data is noisy — it jumps around a bit each time.
  * The car’s motion (speed, acceleration) follows predictable physics.
 
  A Kalman Filter (KF) combines:
  * What you measure (e.g., GPS position)
  * What you predict (based on previous motion and physics)
  to produce a better estimate than either alone.

>> How It Works (Simplified)
   
   The Kalman Filter works in two main steps:

     1 - Prediction step:
     * It predicts the next state (e.g., position, velocity) based on the previous state and a model of the system.
     * Example: "Given my last known position and velocity, I think I’ll be here next."

     2 - Correction (update) step:
     * It updates that prediction using the new measurement.
     * Example: "The GPS reading says I’m a bit off, so let’s adjust slightly."
     It repeats this cycle continuously.

>> Why It’s Used
   
   Because real-world sensors are noisy, and you want smooth, accurate, and reliable data.
   
   Common uses:
   1 - Navigation systems (GPS + IMU fusion)
   2 - Robotics (localization, tracking)
   3 - Drones and aircraft (stabilization, attitude estimation)
   4 - Sensor fusion (combining accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer data)
   5 - Finance & control systems (state estimation)

>>  Example with an MPU6050

    1 - The MPU6050 gives raw data from:
    * A 3-axis accelerometer
    * A 3-axis gyroscope

    2 - Both are noisy:
    * Accelerometer drifts due to vibration and gravity.
    * Gyroscope drifts over time (bias error).

    3 - The Kalman Filter combines both readings:
    * Gyro gives short-term precision.
    * Accelerometer gives long-term stability.

Together, you get a stable and accurate orientation (angle or position).
